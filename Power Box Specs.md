#History
- Some time in the early 2000's (IIRC), J.J. Fail built the NGM layout control power box to house all of the DCC command stations, boosters and accessory power transformers.
- Over the years the box was modified and added to meet the growing needs of an expanding layout.
- Several years ago, Dave Koch added the PSX-3 devices with bypass switches to fix the problem of sound locomotives shorting the layout.

#Project Overview
- While the current power box has met the needs of the club quite well over the years, many recognize that it may have outlived its utility, given the club's present layout design and operational needs.
- The purpose of this document is to capture all of the necessary considerations (electrical, construction, financial, operational, etc.) to provide guidance in the design and construction (or rebuilding) of a new power control box.

#Problems
- Probably the single biggest complaint from train operators is that track shorts on one part of the layout take down the entire layout on the affected track. This is especially challenging on larger layouts where it's not visibly obvious when there's a track shorting problem on the other side of the layout.
- On larger layouts, track shorts aren't detected quick enough (or at all in some cases). This is a known limitation of any electrical system under load and distance. It's not feasible (or even desirable) to completely rebuild our layout bus to lower the resistance any further than already exists. (That would likely require moving from 14 AWG to 10 AWG or larger wire.)
- The yards are typically where most active shorts will occur, but the current system does not isolate the yard.
- Presently, the command station is also acting as a booster. This dual role occasionally causes problems when the booster is overloaded.

#Design Requirements
The new design should meet the following requirements:

##Electrical Requirements
- No booster track feed should exceed 50 feet from the farthest point to the booster.
- All tracks, power districts and sub-districts should be circuit protected from the booster. (PSX-xx and PM42 devices are specifically designed to do this.)
    + Circuit protection will keep the booster from shutting down when there's an inrush current caused by sound locomotives' capacitors recharging on restart.
    + If sub-districts are used, this will also prevent other sub-districts from shutting down when there is an actual short circuit on a track.

##Practical Requirements
- Given the modular nature of the club layouts, the new design needs to be maximally flexible to accommodate any size layout that is likely to be built. This flexibility also needs to include the ability to easily incorporate other modular club systems running DCC.
- Most NGM club members are not experts on DCC best practices in general or on the specifics of how the layout should be wired. Therefore, the new design needs to be as simple to install as possible with basic instructions.
- Balancing flexibility and simplicity will not be easy, but must be considered.

##Construction Requirements

##Financial Requirements
- NGM has a substantial investment in current hardware (time and money). Ideally, the new design will use most (or all) of that investment and only require as little further investment as possible to meet the other requirements.
- That might suggest a modular design that can be added on later as needed.
